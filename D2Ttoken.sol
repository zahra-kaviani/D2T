The function has two types of output for two different types of callers:

Users that call the function directly from a user interface. Typically the user submits a transaction and does not wait for a response, 
which could take an indefinite amount of time. The user can see what happened by looking for the transaction receipt 
(which is identified by the transaction hash) or by looking for the Transfer event.
Other contracts, which call the function as part of an overall transaction. Those contracts get the result immediately, 
because they run in the same transaction, so they can use the function return value.
The same type of output is created by the other functions that change the contract's state.

Allowances permit an account to spend some tokens that belong to a different owner. This is useful, for example,
 for contracts that act as sellers. Contracts cannot monitor for events, so if a buyer were to transfer 
 tokens to the seller contract directly that contract wouldn't know it was paid. Instead, the buyer permits the seller contract
  to spend a certain amount, and the seller transfers that amount. This is done through a function the seller contract calls,
   so the seller contract can know if it was successful.

On one hand, ethereum does not have floating point or fractional variables. On the other hand, humans like being

  somebody wanted to buy a duck's worth of cow.
The solution is to keep track of integers, but count instead
 of the real token a fractional token that is nearly worthless. 
 In the case of ether, the fractional token is called wei, and 10^18 wei 
 is equal to one ETH. At writing, 10,000,000,000,000 wei is approximately one US or Euro cent.
Applications need to know how to display the token balance. 
If a user has 3,141,000,000,000,000,000 wei, is that 3.14 ETH? 31.41 ETH? 
3,141 ETH? In the case of ether it is defined 10^18 wei to the ETH, but for your token you can select a different value.
 If dividing the token doesn't make sense, you can use a _decimals value of zero. If you want to use the same standard as ETH,

Nobody actually owns address zero in Ethereum 
(that is, nobody knows a private key whose matching public key is transformed to the zero address).
 When people use that address, it is usually a software bug - so we fail if the zero address is used as the sender or the recipient.
There are two ways to use this contract:
Use it as a template for your own code
Inherit from it, and override only those functions that you need to modify
The second method is much better because the OpenZeppelin ERC-20 code has already
 been audited and shown to be secure. When you use inheritance it is clear what are
  the functions you modify, and to trust your contract people only need to audit those specific functions.
It is often useful to perform a function each time tokens change hands. However,
_transfer is a very important function and it is possible to write it insecurely (see below), 
so it is best not to override it. The solution is _beforeTokenTransfer, a hook function. You can override this function, 
and it will be called on each transfer.
These are the lines that actually do the transfer. Note that there is nothing between them,
 and that we subtract the transferred amount from the sender before adding it to the recipient. 
 This is important because if there was a call to a different contract in the middle,
  it could have been used to cheat this contract. This way the transfer is atomic, nothing can happen in the middle of it.
