An initial coin offering is a form of crowdfunding that enables new startups to
 generate funds for Its business activities. However, the ICOs being based on the blockchain 
 and cryptocurrencies, the number of investors and their capacity to invest is very speculative since there is no regulating agency which can classify the investors according to their investment potential. To overcome this uncertainty during the funding of the project many of the ICOs opt for a presale.

A presale or an ICO private sale, is a token sale event which is carried out by the blockchain 
companies before the launch of the public sale of tokens.

The major points of difference between ICO and a presale event are

A presale event consists of funding from family, friends, close associates
 and investors with large capitals while, an ICO consists of funding from the general public.
A presale event offers the tokens at a great discount than the ICO.
A presale is seen as a major incentive by the early investor since it gives the possibilities of
 very huge and quick returns when the tokens hit the exchanges for trading. The chances of such huge
  return are comparatively lesser in case of ICOs.
Often a minimum contribution amount is set in the presale, which is much more than that required in an ICO.
Strict KYC and background checks are required for most of the presale, to ensure that no manipulation 
can be done by the early investors. In comparison the number of investors in ICO are far more than the 
early investors and as a result of that, more investors may be permitted.
The liquidity of that coins being offered is least in the presale event because the actual launch of the
 tokens on the exchanges are still a long way away. In comparison, the ICO stage offers liquidity in near future.
During the pre-sale event, most of the products are only on a planning phase and the presale is done for 
funding the initial development of the blockchain. ICO is often held at testing phase of the blockchain and the working product.
In addition to these differences, the risk factor also is a critical aspect to consider for investment in an
 ICO or a presale. The popularity of the project could determine how successful the presale become in terms of reaching the softcap, which is the minimum amount of funds to be raised for the project. In some of the most popular projects, not only the softcap but the hardcap too, is raised during the presale.

What is a crypto airdrop?
A crypto airdrop is a free crypto reward. People who get a crypto airdrop will see fungible or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) appear in their private crypto wallet address. Usually, new crypto projects use airdrops to generate social media buzz or reward early community members by literally sending free assets directly to their wallet.

However, it wouldnâ€™t qualify as an airdrop if you were to pay an exchange, company, or Web3 project to get a token reward. Since crypto airdrops have become immensely popular over time, some projects deliberately mislead new users by claiming they're giving "airdrops" and asking for funds. By definition, crypto airdrops shouldn't cost users anything. 

How do crypto airdrops work? 
If a project wants to give a crypto airdrop, they'll usually set aside a portion of their total token supply to send to targeted cryptocurrency wallet addresses. The hope is that once individuals have the assets theyâ€™ll participate in the product. The project's leaders may announce an upcoming crypto airdrop on social media and detail how they plan to choose who can claim these tokens. 

Sometimes, people can get crypto airdrops if they used a dApp (decentralized app) in the past. Others may get a crypto airdrop for holding a specific token at a particular time. It's also common for Web3 projects to send crypto airdrops to early adopters and active community members. 

Once the crypto airdrop goes live, anyone who meets the eligibility requirements should see the tokens in their private crypto wallet. Since data is transparent on the blockchain, cryptocurrency projects can easily determine the public wallet addresses that meet their criteria. 

Whatâ€™s the purpose of crypto airdrops?
Crypto airdrops are all about marketing. The competition in Web3 is fierce, and new projects need ways to stand out. Offering free tokens is a tried-and-tested marketing technique that tends to generate considerable attention.

Some Web3 developers use crypto airdrops to steal attention from more popular protocols in their target market. For example, the NFT marketplace LooksRare offered 120 million of its LOOKS tokens to people who used the competing site OpenSea in 2021. The LOOKS airdrop helped bring thousands of OpenSea traders to LooksRare when it launched in early 2022.  

However, there are other potential reasons developers might give away crypto airdrops. For instance, some dApps may want to show appreciation to early community members. Others might want to encourage people to use their tokens in DeFi (decentralized finance) or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

These factors were crucial influences on Uniswap's famous airdrop in 2020. In September, the prominent Ethereum decentralized exchange (DEX) announced it would give away 150 million UNI governance tokens to people who used its trading platform. Any Ethereum addresses that swapped tokens on Uniswap beforehand shouldâ€™ve received 400 UNI tokens. Those who added tokens to Uniswap's liquidity pools couldâ€™ve received even more UNI. Because individuals interact with cryptocurrencies via a wallet, this technology is uniquely frictionless in the crypto space.

Many NFT collections have also given out crypto airdrops to encourage community members to hold their tokens. Most famously, the NFT studio Yuga Labs gave anyone holding a Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT a "Mutant Serum" NFT in the summer of 2021. These Mutant Serum NFTs could transform a holder's Bored Ape into a "Mutant Ape." Some of these Mutant Serum and Mutant Ape NFTs have sold for millions of dollars.
